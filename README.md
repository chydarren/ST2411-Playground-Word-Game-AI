# Playground Word Game (AI Bot)

## Introduction

This is a Python program that simulates a two player word game. The program will first prompt the human player to enter his/her name to start
a new game session. A game session begins by showing an initial challenging word (randomly picked by the program). The player and AI bot over
the network will take turns to enter a new word in response to the challenge based on the game rules and earn points.
